# ENVI5809-Final

## Project title: Simulating the Environmental Parameters that influence the distribution of humpback whales along the East Coast of Australia.
by: Jingwen Shi, Ruiqing Wang, Sisilia Ulakai, Yinzhe Peiâ€‹

## Research questions:
1. What are the sea surface temperature range along the humpback whale migration route?
2. Does salinity change influence humpback whale migration?
3. What is the predicted sea surface temperature range along the humpback whale migration route?

## Analysis plan:
