# ENVI5809-Final

## Project title: Simulating the Environmental Parameters that influence the distribution of humpback whales along the East Coast of Australia.
by: Jingwen Shi, Ruiqing Wang, Sisilia Ulakai, Yinzhe Peiâ€‹

## Research questions:
1. What are the sea surface temperature range along the humpback whale migration route?
2. Does salinity change accompanied with humpback whale migration?
3. What is the predicted sea surface temperature range along the humpback whale migration route?

## Analysis plan:
1. Divide different whale individuals and graph their migration routes.
2. Extract Sea Surface Temperature and Salinity data along their routes for each recorded point.
3. Analysis of how do these environmental parameters change with migration route.
4. Use gif and linegraph to show the change of future temperture and to predict how it may influence the humpback whales' migration.
